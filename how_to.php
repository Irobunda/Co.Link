                                <p>As the bus approaches, signal the driver by waving.</p>
                                <p>Let other passengers get off the bus before you board.</p>
                                <p>Allow passengers using the wheelchair lift to board first. </p>
                                <p> If you're using the lift, wait at least five feet from 
                                the door so the driver has room to lower the lift safely.</p> 
                                <p>Use caution when getting on or off the bus.</p>

                                <p style="color:black"><strong>Getting off the Bus</strong></p> 
                                <p>Buses have an automated system that makes audio and visual announcements approaching stops. 
                                <p> The visual announcements are near the ceiling of the bus in the front.
                                <p> Once your stop is announced, signal the driver by pressing the stop button closest to you.
                                <p> Remain seated until the bus comes to a complete stop. </p>
                                <p> Exit quickly through the exit door to allow room for boarding passengers. </p>
                                <p> Once you exit, step away from the bus and wait until it leaves before crossing the street. </p>
                                <p style="color:red"><strong>  Never cross in front of the bus</strong></p>
